    "`8.` When using all 4 latent features, we saw that we could exactly reproduce the user-movie matrix.  Now that we only have 2 latent features, we might measure how well we are able to reproduce the original matrix by looking at the sum of squared errors from each rating produced by taking the dot product as compared to the actual rating.  Find the sum of squared error based on only the two latent features, and use the following cell to test against the solution. "

One reason might be for computational reasons - sure, you may want to reduce the dimensionality of the data you are keeping, but really this isn't the main reason we would want to perform reduce k to lesser than the minimum of the number of movies or users.\n",

    "Let's take a step back for a second.  In this example we just went through, your matrix was very clean.

Furthermore, if we use these \"noisey\" latent features to assist in re-constructing the original user-movie matrix it will potentially (and likely) lead to worse ratings than if we only have latent features associated with signal.   \n",
