    #       A binomial distribution is defined by two variables:

    #       If you know these two values, you can calculate the mean and the standard deviation

    #       For example, if you flip a fair coin 25 times, p = 0.5 and n = 25
    #       You can then calculate the mean and standard deviation with the following formula:
