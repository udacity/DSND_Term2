Say we are managing books for a store, and we want to find all the books published within the last two years about code.

Sometimes there is a method that does exactly what you need. Other times, you need to be a little creative. This example in particular has a useful method you can use.\n",

I'll give you this same notebook, and I'll put a cell right here with code to record the time it takes to run. Write your line of code in between these time start and time end lines."

    "### Tip #2: Know your data structures and which methods are faster\n",
    "In addition to relying on Numpy and pandas, it's often good to double check whether there's a data structure or method in Python you can use to accomplish your task more effectively. For example, in this case do you recall a data structure in Python that stores a group of unique elements and can quickly compute intersections and unions of different groups? You can read more about why sets are more efficient than lists for this task in the link on the bottom of this page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, remember how I said I googled everything? Last time, I was googling how to find common elements in specifically Numpy arrays. But you can go more general and google something like \"how to find common elements in two lists python\" and you'll see posts like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2864842/common-elements-comparison-between-2-lists) that share and compare different answers. And you can see the set being introduced here.\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems to have a lot of great explanation and votes, but ultimately we should try different methods and compare their efficiency for our example. Because different methods perform differently in different contexts. So it's smart to always test for yourself. In the next cell of the Jupyter notebook, find out how long it takes to compute the common elements of `recent_books` and `coding_books` using Python's `set.intersection` method. Here again is some code to measure how long this takes."
