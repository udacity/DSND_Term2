    "# Goal of the ETL Lesson\n",

    "One goal of this ETL pipelines lesson is to take the [World Bank Project data set](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-bank-projects-operations) and merge this data with the [World Bank indicator data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL). Then you'll load the merged data into a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the process, you'll need to transform these data sets in different ways. And finally, you'll write a single Python module that reads in these date sets, transforms them, and loads the results into the database all in one step.\n",
