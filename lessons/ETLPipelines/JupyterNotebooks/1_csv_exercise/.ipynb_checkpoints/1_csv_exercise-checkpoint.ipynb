    "# Goal of the ETL Lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this ETL pipelines lesson is to take the [World Bank Project data set](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-bank-projects-operations) and merge this data with the [World Bank indicator data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL). Then you'll load the merged data into a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the process, you'll need to transform these data sets in different ways. And finally, you'll write a single Python module that reads in these date sets, transforms them, and loads the results into the database all in one step.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Extracting data from a csv file\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in an ETL pipeline is extraction. Data comes in all types of different formats, and you'll practice extracting data from csv files, JSON files, XML files, SQL databases, and the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first exercise, you'll practice extracting data from a CSV file and then navigating through the results. You'll see that extracting data is not always a straight-forward process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise contains a series of coding questions for you to solve. If you get stuck, there is a solution file called 1_csv_exercise_solution.ipynb. You can find this solution file by going to File->Open and then clicking on the file name."
