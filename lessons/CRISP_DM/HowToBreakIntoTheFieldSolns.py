# Solution to Question 4

df['HigherEd'] = df["FormalEducation"].apply(higher_ed)

# Solution to Question 6
sol = {'Everyone should get a higher level of formal education': False,
       'Regardless of formal education, online courses are the top suggested form of education': True,
       'There is less than a 1% difference between suggestions of the two groups for all forms of education': False,
       'Those with higher formal education suggest it more than those who do not have it': True}
